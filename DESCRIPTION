Description:
    The Directed Prediction Index ('DPI') is a causal discovery method
    for observational data designed to quantify the relative endogeneity
    of outcome (Y) versus predictor (X) variables in regression models.
    By comparing the coefficients of determination (R-squared)
    between the Y-as-outcome and X-as-outcome models
    while controlling for sufficient confounders and
    simulating k random covariates, it can quantify relative endogeneity,
    providing a necessary but insufficient condition for causal direction
    from a less endogenous variable (X) to a more endogenous variable (Y).
    Methodological details are provided at
    <https://psychbruce.github.io/DPI/>.
    This package also includes functions for data simulation and network
    analysis (correlation, partial correlation, and Bayesian Networks).
