Description:
    The Directed Prediction Index ('DPI') is
    a simulation-based and conservative method
    for quantifying the relative endogeneity (relative dependence)
    of outcome (Y) versus predictor (X) variables
    in multiple linear regression models.
    By comparing the proportion of variance explained (R-squared)
    between the Y-as-outcome model and the X-as-outcome model
    while controlling for a sufficient number
    of potential confounding variables,
    it suggests a more plausible influence direction
    from a more exogenous variable (X) to a more endogenous variable (Y).
