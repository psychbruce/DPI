\title{DPI: The Directed Prediction Index}
\description{
\if{html}{\figure{logo.png}{options: style='float: right' alt='logo' width='120'}}

The Directed Prediction Index ('DPI') is a simulation-based method for quantifying the relative endogeneity (relative dependence) of outcome (Y) versus predictor (X) variables in multiple linear regression models. By comparing the proportion of variance explained (R-squared) between the Y-as-outcome model and the X-as-outcome model while controlling for a sufficient number of potential confounding variables, it suggests a more plausible influence direction from a more exogenous variable (X) to a more endogenous variable (Y). Methodological details are provided at \url{https://psychbruce.github.io/DPI/}.
